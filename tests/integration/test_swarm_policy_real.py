"""A swarm on an approval-policy board, on the real Hermes kanban core.

Pins the three things the plugin's own assembly (kanban_swarm_policy.py) must guarantee:
- every result card (workers, verifier, synthesizer) carries a policy, and the structure root carries none;
- the root's instant completion does not trip `review_policy_done_guard` and is not an approval;
- no worker is ever `ready` without its policy — the policies are committed before `recompute_ready` runs.
